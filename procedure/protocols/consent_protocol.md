# Informed Consent Protocol

This study consists of three data collection surveys (prior to course, after course, one year after the course) and one electronic consent survey for use of content created during the course and for contact information for the final survey, modeled after the recommended written consent form template.

The more informed consent document included in the electronic consent survey is to be provided in paper form at the beginning of the course, and is also linked as a downloadable PDF from the electronic consent survey.

For the three data collection surveys, electronic statements of informed consent are embedded in the surveys following recommended guidelines from the IRB website for exempt, survey research. The text of this informed consent is written as follows:

theory-building and STEM education through reproductions and replications in the
geographical sciences" and this survey is designed to assess and inform pedagogical effectiveness.
