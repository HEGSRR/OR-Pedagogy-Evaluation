# Title

Assessing pedagogy for teaching reproducibility and replicability in the geographic sciences

# Funding
National Science Foundation

# Project Summary

The scientific community has increasingly acknowledged the importance of reproducibility and replicability.
Our research project is one of several across the sciences developing reproduction and replication studies, infrastructure to facilitate reproducibility, and curricula to teach reproducibility.
Now, it is time to design pedagogy for geography curricula to train the next generation of scientists in reproducible and replicable research methods.
The purpose of this research project is to use artifacts of public student work and a series of short online Qualtrics surveys to collect data on students' engagement with reproducibility and replicability and experience in courses teaching reproducible and replicable research methods in order to inform future pedagogical design.

# Study Site

The site of the study is the Qualtrics survey platform and the public GitHub.com website.
The participants are students enrolled in advanced geography methods courses at Middlebury College and University of California, Santa Barbara.

# Recruitment and Consent

## Subjects

The target population for this research is students enrolled in advanced geography methods courses at Middlebury College and University of California, Santa Barbara.
Participants under the age of 18 are excluded from the study, and are very unlikely to have met the prerequisites for registration in the target courses.

## Estimated number of subjects

The fall 2023 course at Middlebury has 21 students enrolled.
Enrollment in future courses is unknown, but likely between 5 and 25.

## Recruitment

Students have heard about the course through word of mouth and recommendation of other academic advisors.
The research project will be introduced on the first day of class, and students will be invited to complete the first survey in class.
Emails will be concise, and are attached to this protocol as IRB_Contact_Email.pdf.
Students enrolled in the course will receive an email invitation to the survey based on a Qualtrics distribution list built from the class roster.
The professor will step outside of the room for the duration of the survey so that participation will be anonymous.

# Compensation

There is no material compensation for participation.
However, we hope that the students will enjoy a transformational educational experience and benefit professionally from the skills and lessons taught.

# Consent

Informed consent is stated at the beginning of each survey and participation in each survey explicitly implies consent.
A special fourth electronic survey will be used to obtain consent for inclusion of student academic work.

# Methods

## Project Goals

The goal of the project is to assess pedagogical effectiveness and inform future pedagogical development by answering the following questions about teaching open and reproducible research practices (ORRP) through longitudinal surveys and evaluation of student work.

1. Is the teaching design effective at increasing awareness of ORRP?
2. Are students able to apply ORRP effectively in the course?
3. Do students continue to apply ORRP in other courses or future work?
4. Does teaching ORRP increase scientific literacy?
5. Do students gain confidence in scientific research skills?
6. Does teaching reproduction and replication studies work as project-based learning?
7. Are the benefits of project-based learning also achieved while teaching ORRP and reproduction/replication studies?

## Methods

- [x] Survey, questionnaire, or test.
- [x] Other

Students post their coursework to public websites and repositories on GitHub.com. At the end of the course, I will use a very brief electronic survey (uploaded as the consent document) to solicit electronic consent for using the publicly visible coursework content on GitHub.com to assess teaching effectiveness.

Anonymous course evaluations are collected electronically for all Middlebury College courses. I will also use this anonymous information collected as normal educational practice in the research.

## Survey distribution and collection details

There are three surveys: 1) at the beginning of the course, 2) at the end of the course, and 3) one year after the course.
Surveys will be distributed electronically using Qualtrics. A distribution list of email address and random identification numbers is entered into Qualtrics based on the course roster and used to send email invitations for the first two surveys. The surveys do not ask any personally identifiable information and use the Qualtrics option to "Anonymize responses. Don’t record respondents’ IP Address, location data, and contact info." Participation is optional and participants can skip questions or close the survey at any time.

Following the second survey, a very short follow-up survey will serve only to ask participants for consent to reference their online public work on GitHub.com in the research, and for an updated email address for the third survey. This survey contains the personally-identifiable information of participant email addresses, and will be used to store consent and to update the distribution list for the third survey. This email information is necessary to identify which public GitHub profiles I am permitted to use in the research and to contact students who may be graduating and changing their email address.

We use the Qualtrics API and the QualtRics package for R to load a temporary version of the data, report aggregate demographic information, drop possible identifiers (e.g. affiliation with a minority group in science and engineering), and save a permanent de-identified version of data for analysis and archival.
We never save a permanent version of identifiable data outside of the password-protected Qualtrics database.

## "Other" methods:

I will use students' GitHub content to enhance the evidence from surveys with qualitative data. In any case that I quote students or reference unique intellectual contributions, I will cite student's work appropriately to give them appropriate credit.
I will also code student work on GitHub for evidence of cognitive strategies for learning and Bloom's taxonomy of learning outcomes in order to report aggregate outcomes, e.g. "15 of 20 students demonstrated evidence of the "create" objective in Bloom's taxonomy..."
GitHub is designed for sharing intellectual work, including functions to "clone" (a fancy GitHub term for download) any repository to your local computer. Therefore I will "clone" students' public repositories to an external hard drive for evaluation purposes if they have provided electronic consent to do this via the consent Qualtrics survey.

I will use course evaluations to supplement surveys with anonymous qualitative data.

## Project method

Research participants have enrolled a course on reproducible and replicable geographic research methods. At the beginning of the course, participants will be invited to complete a pre-course Qualtrics survey via email. We expect the survey to take up to 10 minutes.

The students will then proceed with the course as usual. In this course, students post all of their work publicly on the GitHub.com websites and repositories.

At the end of the course, participants will be invited to complete a post-course Qualtrics survey via email. We expect this survey to take up to 10 or 15 minutes.

At this time, we will send another short survey invitation by email: this one to ask for an email address to use in a future survey and to ask for consent to use students' coursework on the public GitHub.com website. If students consent to the use of their coursework, the work will be downloaded onto an external hard drive for storage and analysis. The consent process will remind students that they can delete or revise the content on GitHub after the course.

Finally, one year after the course concludes, we will send a final follow-up survey via email invitation. This final survey will also take up to 10 or 15 minutes.

# Privacy and Confidentiality

- [x] Data will be collected confidentially.

## Plan to protect data

Data will be stored on the password protected and ethics-compliant Qualtrics server. The project will be shared only with the PI and collaborators reported to this IRB protocol.

The surveys use the Qualtrics option to "Anonymize responses. Don’t record respondents’ IP Address, location data, and contact info."
Survey data does not contain any personal identifiers.
Data can be linked across the three surveys using a random identification number.
The only link between the random identification number and contact email addresses is in a password-protected Qualtrics distribution list.
We use the Qualtrics API and the QualtRics package for R to load and save permanent de-identified versions of survey data for analysis and archival. If numbers of any demographic groups are too small to prevent identification (e.g. if fewer than 5 students report affiliation with an underrepresented group in STEM), then we will report that data in aggregate and drop it from any versions saved outside of Qualtrics.

We will keep electronic consent to use coursework on GitHub in the Qualtrics database only. For those students who consent, a copy of their public GitHub data will be downloaded (cloned) onto an external hard drive for use in Dr. Holler's office. We will not make or archive any additional copies of this data because it is already public and archived on GitHub.com. The data will be qualitatively coded in a local NVivo database.

Anonymous versions of the data will be archived on GitHub.com and OSF.io.

## Risk analysis

We do not anticipate any significant immediate or long-term risks associated with this research.
There is always a remote possibility of security breaches for databases like Qualtrics where personal information is stored.
However, the survey does not ask participants about any risky information, and students' work is all public on GitHub.com.

## Benefits

Participants benefit from the research in the form of learning from an innovative curriculum. Additionally, by participating in the survey, participants will be able to have a more tailored course experience. Additionally, further contact after one year has been shown to increase uptake of open and reproducible research practices after courses.

## Benefits to discipline or society

We hope that there will be significant benefits to science and society. Transparency, openness, and reproducibility are increasingly recognized across disciplines and funding organizations as high priorities for the integrity of research and for equitable public access to research with social implications. In order to change the culture of research to adopt more open and reproducible practices, we are developing infrastructure, curricula, and workshops and outreach. This research will help us to improve our curricular components.
