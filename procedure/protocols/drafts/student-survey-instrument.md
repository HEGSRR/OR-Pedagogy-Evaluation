## Survey of Reproduction and Replications in Geographic Education

Version 1.2 | August 22, 2023

#### Welcome
Welcome to our survey studying reproducible research practices in the geographical sciences.
This research is funded by the National Science Foundation (BCS-2049837).
You have been invited to participate in this survey because you are a student in a geographic methods course in which reproduction and/or replications were used to teach geographic concepts.
Your participation will help us better understand how students perceive class reproductions/replications, and how to better use these techniques to train future students.
Your participation is in no way connected to your course grade, or the instructors assessment of your participation or performance in the course.

If you agree to participate, you will be presented with a series of questions about the in-class activities you participated in during the course.
We expect this survey to take less than 15-20 minutes to complete.

#### Consent
You will be asked to confirm that you are eligible and consent to participation  at the beginning of the survey.
Complete details about the survey are included in the **Consent Form (<< Insert Linked PDF>>)**.
This form is was also presented at the beginning of the course and is available at the **<< Insert HEGSRR Project Website >>**.

The data you provide may be published in peer reviewed papers, presented at academic conferences, and used in teaching workshops.
The survey is designed to record the course in which you were enrolled.
No other personally identifiable information is recorded.
Your IP address and location will not be recorded.
You may stop the survey at any time, or skip questions you do not wish to answer.

#### Clarification of Terms
For the purposes of this survey, we adopt the following definitions

**Reproducibility** - the ability of research results to be duplicated by an independent researcher *using the same materials, procedures, and conditions of analysis* that were used in the original study.

**Replicability** - the ability of consistent research results to be obtained by an independent researcher when following the same, or similar, procedures as in the original study, but with the independent researcher *collecting and using their own data* or *purposefully modifying a procedural or contextual parameter*.

More succinctly, a study is reproduced when it is *repeated exactly*, using the same data and methods the same results are obtained.
Research has been replicated when *new data are collected*, and the same, or similar, methods are used to produce a result consistent with prior studies.
